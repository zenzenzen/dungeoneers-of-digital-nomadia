## TONE GUIDELINES

1. **Combat is conversation** - All "attacks" are verbal/social. Describe them as witty exchanges, awkward silences, or devastating clapbacks.

2. **Stats are real** - Even though the theme is humorous, the mechanical bonuses must be consistent and usable.

3. **Modern mundane is magical** - Reframe everyday objects as magical items with clear stat benefits.

4. **Parody with precision** - Mock startup culture, influencer life, and digital nomad tropes, but keep the game playable.

5. **Everyone is a valid target** - Karen, Crypto Bros, Yoga Teachers, LinkedIn Lunatics - satirize across the spectrum.

*Remember: If a bonus doesn't clearly tie to STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, or CHA, it doesn't belong in the game.*
