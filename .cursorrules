**Game Mechanics**
- [ ] All bonuses reference one of the 6 core stats
- [ ] Damage specifies type AND associated stat modifier
- [ ] Skills map to exactly one ability
- [ ] Equipment bonuses are reasonable for rarity (+1 common, +2 uncommon, +3 rare, +4 very rare, +5 legendary)

- [ ] Defensive abilities specify: trigger, duration, stat (if any)
- [ ] Humor is maintained but mechanics are clear

**Database Readiness** *(See DATABASE & BACKEND DESIGN GUIDELINES section)*
- [ ] Unique `id` assigned as FIRST column (format: `[type]_[snake_case_name]`)
- [ ] All references use `id` values, not display names
- [ ] Enum fields use only defined enum values from the ENUM TABLES
- [ ] Numeric fields properly typed (no text in number fields)
- [ ] Complex fields (bonuses, attacks) follow structured format
- [ ] Metadata included: `version`, `tags`, `is_active`

---

## EXAMPLE: COMPLETE ITEM ENTRY

```csv
name,type,rarity,cost,description,bonuses
Noise Cancelling Headphones of Isolation,Headgear,Rare,3 gp,"Blocks out haters. Advantage on Concentration checks. +2 to WIS Saves vs Sonic and Verbal attacks.","+2 WIS Saves (Sonic/Verbal), Advantage Concentration"
```

## EXAMPLE: COMPLETE ATTACK ACTION

```
### Gaslight (Deception vs CR)

- **Target**: Enemy's Cringe Resistance
- **Damage**: 1d8 + CHA modifier psychic damage
- **Critical**: Target is Confused (disadvantage on next action)
- **Flavor**: "Are you sure you said that? I think you're remembering it wrong."
```

## EXAMPLE: COMPLETE CLASS ENTRY

```csv
name,hit_die,primary_stat,saves,features
Digital Nomad,d8,DEX,Dex/Int,"WiFi Sense (+WIS to locate signals), Tax Evasion (DEX save to avoid fiscal consequences), Favored Terrain: Cafe (+2 to all checks in coffee shops)"
```

---

## TONE GUIDELINES

1. **Combat is conversation** - All "attacks" are verbal/social. Describe them as witty exchanges, awkward silences, or devastating clapbacks.

2. **Stats are real** - Even though the theme is humorous, the mechanical bonuses must be consistent and usable.

3. **Modern mundane is magical** - Reframe everyday objects as magical items with clear stat benefits.

4. **Parody with precision** - Mock startup culture, influencer life, and digital nomad tropes, but keep the game playable.

5. **Everyone is a valid target** - Karen, Crypto Bros, Yoga Teachers, LinkedIn Lunatics - satirize across the spectrum.

---

## DATABASE & BACKEND DESIGN GUIDELINES

> All content should be designed with future video game / mobile app database integration in mind.

### REQUIRED: Unique Identifiers (Primary Keys)

Every content entry MUST include a unique `id` field as the **first column** in CSV files:

```csv
id,name,type,...
item_noise_cancel_headphones,Noise Cancelling Headphones of Isolation,Headgear,...
spell_gaslight,Gaslight,Enchantment,...
class_influencer,Influencer,d8,...
monster_linkedin_lunatic,LinkedIn Lunatic,Humanoid,...
```

#### ID Naming Convention
```
[entity_type]_[snake_case_name]

Examples:
  item_hoodie_anonymity
  spell_cancel_culture
  class_crypto_bro
  monster_reply_guy
  npc_barista_oracle
  skill_wifi_dowsing
  feat_main_character
  background_trust_fund
  quest_great_wifi_hunt
```

- **Lowercase only**, underscores for spaces
- **Prefix** with entity type for cross-table clarity
- **Unique across entire game** - no two entities share an ID
- **Immutable** - once assigned, never change (breaks foreign keys)

---

### FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES

When content references other content, use the `id` field, NOT the display name:

```csv
# CORRECT - Using IDs for relationships
id,name,required_class,prerequisite_feat
feat_advanced_gatekeeping,Advanced Gatekeeping,class_influencer,feat_basic_gatekeeping

# WRONG - Using display names (fragile, not normalized)
name,required_class,prerequisite_feat
Advanced Gatekeeping,Influencer,Basic Gatekeeping
```

#### Common Foreign Key Relationships

| Source Entity | Foreign Key Field | Target Entity |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Character | `class_id`, `background_id`, `race_id` | Classes, Backgrounds, Races |
| Spell | `class_ids` (array) | Classes |
| Item | `required_class_id` | Classes |
| Feat | `prerequisite_feat_ids` (array) | Feats |
| Quest | `location_id`, `npc_ids` (array) | Locations, NPCs |
| Encounter | `monster_ids` (array), `location_id` | Monsters, Locations |
| NPC | `class_id`, `background_id` | Classes, Backgrounds |

---

### ENUM TABLES (Lookup Values)

Categorical fields MUST use standardized enum values. These will become lookup tables in the database.

#### `enum_stat`
```
STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA
```

#### `enum_damage_type`
```
psychic, sonic, reputation, necrotic, cringe, poison, bludgeoning, slashing, piercing, radiant, force
```

#### `enum_rarity`
```
common, uncommon, rare, very_rare, legendary, artifact
```

#### `enum_item_type`
```
headgear, eyewear, armor, footwear, accessory, weapon, wondrous_item, potion, wand, container
```

#### `enum_size`
```
tiny, small, medium, large, huge, gargantuan
```

#### `enum_creature_type`
```
humanoid, beast, monstrosity, undead, fiend, celestial, construct, elemental, fey, dragon, aberration, ooze, plant
```

#### `enum_spell_school`
```
abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, transmutation
```

#### `enum_condition`
```
triggered, cancelled, shadowbanned, burnout, cringed, confused, charmed, exhaustion, blinded, deafened, frightened, grappled, incapacitated, invisible, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, stunned, unconscious
```

#### `enum_currency`
```
cp, sp, gp, btc, exposure, therapy_hours
```

#### `enum_action_type`
```
action, bonus_action, reaction, free_action, movement
```

When adding content, use ONLY values from these enums. If a new value is needed, add it to this list first.

---

### STRUCTURED DATA FIELDS (JSON-Ready)

Complex fields should be structured for easy JSON parsing. Use consistent formats:

#### Stat Block Format
```csv
# Store as JSON object in database
abilities,"{""str"": 10, ""dex"": 14, ""con"": 12, ""int"": 16, ""wis"": 13, ""cha"": 18}"

# In CSV, use pipe-delimited shorthand that can be parsed:
abilities,"STR:10|DEX:14|CON:12|INT:16|WIS:13|CHA:18"
```

#### Bonus/Effect Format
```csv
# Structured bonus format (parseable to JSON)
bonuses,"stat_bonus:WIS:+2|save_bonus:WIS:sonic:+2|advantage:concentration"

# Parses to:
{
  "stat_bonuses": [{"stat": "WIS", "value": 2}],
  "save_bonuses": [{"stat": "WIS", "context": "sonic", "value": 2}],
  "advantages": ["concentration"]
}
```

#### Attack Format
```csv
# Structured attack format
attacks,"name:Gaslight|type:spell|stat:CHA|damage:1d8|damage_type:psychic|range:30|effect:confused"

# Multiple attacks separated by semicolon:
attacks,"name:Gaslight|...; name:Clap Back|..."
```

#### Cost Format
```csv
# Standardized cost format (always use lowest denomination or structured)
cost_cp,350
# OR
cost,"{""gp"": 3, ""sp"": 5}"
# OR CSV shorthand:
cost,"3gp5sp"
```

---

### NUMERIC FIELDS

Always use proper data types for numeric values:

| Field Type | Format | Example |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Dice | String pattern `NdX` or `NdX+M` | `2d6`, `1d8+3` |
| Stat Score | Integer 1-30 | `14` |
| Modifier | Signed Integer | `-2`, `+3` |
| Level | Integer 0-20 | `5` |
| CR | Decimal or Fraction | `0.25`, `0.5`, `1`, `17` |
| Distance | Integer (feet) | `30`, `60` |
| Duration | String pattern | `1 minute`, `1 hour`, `instantaneous`, `concentration, up to 1 minute` |
| Cost | Integer (copper) or structured | `350` or `3gp5sp` |
| Weight | Decimal (lbs) | `2.5` |

---

### ARRAY FIELDS

For fields that contain multiple values, use consistent delimiters:

```csv
# Semicolon for arrays of simple values
classes,"class_influencer;class_crypto_bro;class_digital_nomad"
skills,"skill_content_creation;skill_wifi_dowsing"

# Semicolon for arrays of complex objects (each object uses pipes internally)
attacks,"name:Gaslight|damage:1d8+CHA|type:psychic; name:Ratio|damage:2d6|type:reputation"
```

---

### COMPUTED FIELDS (Backend Logic)

Mark fields that should be computed at runtime rather than stored:

| Field | Formula | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `modifier` | `floor((score - 10) / 2)` | Computed from stat score |
| `proficiency_bonus` | Level-based lookup | `+2` at levels 1-4, etc. |
| `spell_save_dc` | `8 + proficiency + stat_mod` | Computed per caster |
| `chill_max` | `hit_die_avg + (CON_mod × level)` | Computed per character |
| `cringe_resistance` | `10 + WIS_mod + CHA_mod + armor` | Computed per character |

In CSV, you can include these for reference but prefix with `_computed_`:
```csv
id,name,stat_wis,stat_cha,_computed_cr_base
char_001,Test Character,14,16,15
```

---

### VERSIONING & METADATA

Include metadata fields for content management:

```csv
# Recommended metadata columns (at end of CSV)
...,version,created_at,updated_at,tags,is_active

# Example
item_hoodie,...,1.0,2024-01-15,2024-03-20,"stealth;urban;clothing",true
```

- `version` - Semantic version for balance changes
- `created_at` / `updated_at` - ISO 8601 timestamps
- `tags` - Searchable keywords (semicolon-delimited)
- `is_active` - Boolean for soft-delete/deprecation

---

### LOCALIZATION-READY TEXT

Separate display text from mechanical data:

```csv
# Good: Mechanical fields separate from flavor
id,name_key,type,damage_dice,damage_type,flavor_key
spell_gaslight,SPELL_GASLIGHT_NAME,enchantment,1d8,psychic,SPELL_GASLIGHT_DESC

# Localization file (separate):
SPELL_GASLIGHT_NAME=Gaslight
SPELL_GASLIGHT_DESC=Are you sure that happened? Make the target doubt their own memory.
```

For MVP, name and description can remain inline, but avoid embedding flavor in mechanical fields.

---

### INDEX-WORTHY FIELDS

These fields should be indexed in the database for fast queries:

| Entity | Index Fields |
|--------|--------------|
| All | `id` (primary key), `name`, `is_active` |
| Items | `type`, `rarity`, `cost_cp` |
| Spells | `level`, `school`, `class_ids` |
| Monsters | `challenge_rating`, `creature_type`, `size` |
| NPCs | `location_id`, `class_id` |
| Quests | `location_id`, `min_level`, `is_main_quest` |
| Skills | `ability` (stat) |
| Classes | `primary_stat`, `hit_die` |

---

### CSV COLUMN ORDER STANDARD

For consistency and database import reliability, use this column order:

```
1. id (PRIMARY KEY)
2. name (display name)
3. type/category fields
4. core mechanical fields (stats, dice, costs)
5. reference fields (foreign keys)
6. text/description fields
7. structured complex fields (bonuses, attacks)
8. metadata fields (version, timestamps, tags)
```

---

### DATA VALIDATION RULES

Before adding content, validate:

- [ ] `id` is unique across the entire entity type
- [ ] `id` follows naming convention: `[type]_[snake_case]`
- [ ] All foreign keys reference existing `id` values
- [ ] Enum fields use only defined enum values
- [ ] Numeric fields contain valid numbers (no text in damage dice)
- [ ] Array fields use correct delimiter (semicolon)
- [ ] Complex fields use correct structure format
- [ ] No display names used where IDs should be

---

```

---

*Remember: If a bonus doesn't clearly tie to STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, or CHA, it doesn't belong in the game.*

*Remember: If content doesn't have a unique `id`, it can't exist in a database.*
