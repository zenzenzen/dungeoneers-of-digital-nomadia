# ⚔️ Dungeoneers of Digital Nomadia

## 🎲 What Is This?

**Dungeoneers of Digital Nomadia** is a tabletop RPG system that parodies modern digital nomad culture, startup life, influencer drama, and the eternal quest for good WiFi. Instead of swords and spells, adventurers wield laptops and lattes. Instead of hit points, you have **Chill**. Instead of armor class, you have **Cringe Resistance**.

Combat isn't physical—it's *social*. You **Gaslight**, **Gatekeep**, and **Girlboss** your way through encounters with Karens, Crypto Bros, LinkedIn Lunatics, and the dreaded Meeting That Could Have Been An Email.

## 🧠 Core Mechanics

### The Six Stats
| Stat | Governs |
|------|---------|
| **Strength** | Hustle endurance, blocking exits, forcing social compliance |
| **Dexterity** | Typing speed, dodging questions, ghosting |
| **Constitution** | Burnout resistance, jet lag immunity, caffeine tolerance |
| **Intelligence** | Fact-checking, coding, gatekeeping |
| **Wisdom** | Reading vibes, spotting manipulation, WiFi dowsing |
| **Charisma** | Clout, content quality, gaslighting power |

### Combat Stats
- **Chill** (HP) — At 0 Chill, you're **Triggered** and must leave the scene to cry in the bathroom
- **Cringe Resistance** (AC) — How hard it is to embarrass you: `10 + WIS mod + CHA mod`
- **Vibe Check** (Initiative) — `d20 + CHA modifier`. Highest roll sets the tone.

### Damage Types
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Psychic** | Mental/emotional damage (the main damage type) |
| **Sonic** | Loud, annoying, grating attacks |
| **Reputation** | Damage to social standing (harder to heal) |
| **Cringe** | Secondhand embarrassment damage |
| **Necrotic** | Energy drain, will-sapping tedium |

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

1. **Combat is conversation** — All "attacks" are verbal/social: witty clapbacks, awkward silences, devastating ratio
2. **Stats are real** — Humor is paramount, but mechanics are consistent and playable
3. **Modern mundane is magical** — AirPods are Headgear of Isolation, Ring Lights are summoned for +2 CHA
4. **Everyone is a valid target** — Karens, Crypto Bros, Yoga Cultists, LinkedIn Lunatics, and yes, Digital Nomads themselves
5. **Parody with precision** — Mock the culture, keep the game functional

*Remember: If you reach 0 Chill, you're not dead—you're just Triggered. Take a Self-Care short rest and come back when you've processed your emotions.*
