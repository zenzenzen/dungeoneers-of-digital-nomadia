# Social Combat System

In the world of Digital Nomadia, physical violence is gauche (and illegal). Instead, adventurers engage in **Social Combat**, a high-stakes battle of wits, ego, and brand management.

## Core Stats

### Chill (Hit Points)
**Chill** represents your mental stability, ego, and ability to remain unbothered.
- **0 Chill**: You have lost your cool. You are **Triggered** and must leave the scene to "process your trauma" (cry in the bathroom/rant on Twitter).
- **Restoring Chill**: Chill is restored by "Self-Care" (Short Rest) or "Therapy/Retreat" (Long Rest).

### Cringe Resistance (Armor Class)
**Cringe Resistance (CR)** represents how hard it is to embarrass you or get under your skin.
- **Base CR**: 10 + Wisdom Modifier + Charisma Modifier.
- **Armor**: Replaced by "Outfit Quality" and "Brand Strength".

### Vibe Check (Initiative)
Combat starts with a **Vibe Check**. Roll d20 + Charisma modifier. Highest roll sets the tone of the conversation.
